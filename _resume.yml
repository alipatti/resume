    - title: Ole or Carl?
      summary: A machine learning model which classifies St. Olaf and Carleton students with 67 percent accuracy based exclusively on headshots.
      bullets:
        - Originally built as a joke to refute claims that I look like an Ole and test the validity of a long-standing stereotype that students from the two colleges look meaningfully different.
        - Under the hood the model uses a linear support-vector classifier on vector embeddings of students' faces.
        - The final product is a web-app in which students can see theirs and their friends' 'Ole scores'â€“a hand-wavey metric loosely based on one's distance from the decision boundary.
        - Training data was taken from each college's directory and LinkedIn.
