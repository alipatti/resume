      summary: Extend recent results in cryptography involving message-reporting in end-to-end encrypted messaging services. Supervised by Professor Nicholas Hopper.
      bullets:
        - Removed assumptions of moderator honesty by implementing a committee moderation system based on distributed Schnorr signatures and threshold ElGamal encryption.
        # - Removed the platform's responsibility while retaining all the security guarantees of previous papers, meaning that my system can be implemented today on top of vanilla Signal or WhatsApp with no modification of the underlying EEMS.
        # - Implemented improvements in Rust and benchmarked the implementation against the protocols described in previous works.
        # - Preprint available at ??? (submitted to ???, ???).

        - Collaborated closely in a team of three to ensure all outgoing groups' needs were met.

  projects:
    - title: Ole or Carl?
      summary: A machine learning model which classifies St. Olaf and Carleton students with 67 percent accuracy based exclusively on faces.
      bullets:
        - Originally built as a joke to refute claims that I look like an Ole and test the validity of a long-standing stereotype that students from the two colleges look meaningfully different.
        - Under the hood the model uses a linear support-vector classifier on vector embeddings of students' faces.
        - The final product is a web-app in which students can see theirs and their friends' 'Ole scores'â€“a hand-wavey metric loosely based on one's distance from the model's decision boundary.
        - Training data was taken from each college's directory and LinkedIn.
