    - title: Research Assistant
      subtitle: Privacy and Cryptography Lab
      institution: University of Minnesota
      location: Minneapolis, Minnesota
      date: [2022-09, null]
      summary: Improved a recent cryptographic protocol for securely reporting abusive messages in end-to-end encrypted messaging services (e.g. WhatsApp, Signal, Facebook Messenger). To be presented at IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2023.
      bullets:
        - Developed a distributed moderation system based on threshold cryptography that both improves the protocol's security and helps the moderation system resolve whether or not to act on a reported message.
        - Implemented the modified protocol in Rust and benchmarked its performance against the existing literature.
        - Advised by Professor Nicholas Hopper.

  projects:
    - title: Ole or Carl?
      summary: A machine learning model that distinguishes faces of St. Olaf and Carleton students based on state-of-the art vector embeddings.
      bullets:
        - Originally built as a joke to refute claims that I look like an Ole and test the validity of a long-standing stereotype that students from the two colleges look meaningfully different.
        - Under the hood the model uses a linear support-vector machine to classify state-of-the art face embeddings produced by a pre-trained resnet model from the dlib C++ library. It achieves ~65% cross-validated accuracy which, while not fantastic, is meaningfully better than random choice.
        - The final product is a web-app in which students can search and see their friends' 'Ole scores'â€“a hand-wavey metric loosely based on the distance of one's face embedding from the model's decision boundary.
        - Training data was scraped from each college's directory and LinkedIn.

    - title: Chirple
      summary: Play Wordle head-to-head against a bot that makes fun of you for your bad guesses.
      bullets:
        - Chirple makes the guess that yields the most expected information (in Shannon's sense of the word) and makes fun of you if you don't. Under some reasonable assumptions, Chirple's guesses can be proven optimal.
        - Inspiration for insults was taken from the (very creative) mouths of collegiate sideline hecklers.
